# About this Course {-}

You will expand your current knowledge of Git and GitHub to help your research be more collaborative, reproducible, and transparent. You will learn how to develop your work independently on a “branch” before “merging” it back to a shared repository, and resolve any conflicts along the way. Then, you will learn about the pull request model of collaboration on GitHub and how to conduct code reviews.


## Target Audience

Researchers who want to work on a code base collaboratively in a version-controlled manner.
