## Introductions

-   Who am I?

. . .

-   What is DaSL?

. . .

-   Who are you?

    -   Name, pronouns, group you work in

    -   What brought you here?

## Goals of the workshop

. . .

-   Understand the concept of branching and merging for collaborative and diverging work.

. . .

-   Create your own branch for independent work from a collaborative repository, and use a pull request on GitHub to receive feedback before merging.

. . .

-   Create your own branch for independent work on your private repository locally, and merging your work when your independent work is complete.

## Branching and Merging

. . .

Linear:

```         
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
```

. . .

Branching:

```         
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
            ^
             \
              --- o <-- o
```

. . .

Branching and Merging:

```         
o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- o
            ^            /
             \          v
              --- o <-- o
```

. . .

**Branching**: when branching commit paths are created.

**Merging**: when two branches are integrated together.

## Set up

1.  Login to your GitHub account: https://github.com/login

. . .

2.  Create a Replit account and "fork" this project: https://replit.com/@clo22/CollaborativeGitGitHubDaSl

. . .

4.  In your Replit shell,

```         
sh setup.sh
```

You will be asked how you want to log in, and pick the following:

```         
Link for authentication: https://github.com/login/device
? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS
? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser
```

You will be given a code, and you will provide that code to GitHub via <https://github.com/login/device>.


## Getting started with branches

Let's create a local repository to practice branching:

. . .

```         
% mkdir sandbox
% cd sandbox
% git init
% touch README
% git add README
% git commit -m "Added README"
```

. . .

Let's look at the branches in this repository:

```         
% git branch
* main
```

The star `*` shows which branch we are looking at.

We are on the `main` branch in this repository, as expected.

## Ways to look at a branch

Let's create a new branch:

. . .

```         
% git branch development
% git branch
  development
* main
```

. . .

Another way to look at which branch we are on is via `git log`:

```         
% git log
commit 657fcbea5a023041d359a8f1fcfc9fbf7e64f68e (HEAD -> main, development)
Merge: 875d774 413b490
Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 6 23:47:39 2023 +0000

   Initial commit
```

The `HEAD` **pointer** tells us "What am I looking at?" in our local file system. 


## Committing to the development branch

. . .

```         
% git checkout development
Switched to branch 'development'
% echo "Additional README info" >> README.md 
% git add README.md 
% git commit -m "updated README"
```

. . .

Let's look at our `git log`:

```         
% git log
commit 260c8099f0ea82199805325a6fbe26bfc3cbd1aa (HEAD -> development)
Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 7 00:14:02 2023 +0000

    updated README

commit 657fcbea5a023041d359a8f1fcfc9fbf7e64f68e (main)
Merge: 875d774 413b490
Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 6 23:47:39 2023 +0000

    Initial commit
```

Now, our branch `development` is ahead of the `main` branch by one commit. We can toggle between two branches via `git checkout` as before.


## Merging

. . .

All you have to do is checkout the branch you wish to merge into and then run `git merge [branchName]` on the branch of interest:

``` 
% git checkout main
% git merge development 
Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/fhdsl/Collaborative_Git_GitHub_Student_Practice
Updating 657fcbe..260c809
Fast-forward
% git log
commit 260c8099f0ea82199805325a6fbe26bfc3cbd1aa (HEAD -> main, development)
Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 7 00:14:02 2023 +0000

    updated README

commit 657fcbea5a023041d359a8f1fcfc9fbf7e64f68e 
Merge: 875d774 413b490
Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 6 23:47:39 2023 +0000

    Initial commit
```

## Accessing our shared repository

1. In Replit shell,

```
%cd ~
%git clone https://github.com/fhdsl/Collaborative_Git_GitHub_Student_Practice.git
```

2. Open up https://github.com/fhdsl/Collaborative_Git_GitHub_Student_Practice in browser. 


## Pull request model

A **pull request** is a way to propose changes from a branch before it is merged back into the main repository. It is just like `git merge`, but it requires more documentation and confirmation. 

. . .

## Creating a branch on the remote

![](images/git_branch.png)

## Making changes to this new branch locally

The branch `clo2_development` is created on the remote, but it hasn't been updated locally. We run `git pull` locally to update it and switch to that branch via `git checkout`.

. . .

```         
% git pull
From https://github.com/fhdsl/S2_Collaborative_Git_GitHub_Student_Practice
 * [new branch]      clo2_development -> origin/clo2_development
Already up to date.

% git checkout clo2_development
Branch 'clo2_development' set up to track remote branch 'clo2_development' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'clo2_development'
```


## Making changes to new branch

. . .

```         
% touch clo2.txt
% echo "hello" > clo2.txt
% git add README.md
% git commit -m "edited README.md"
% git push
```

. . .

When you have pushed changes to the branch, you will see an option to *"Compare & pull request"*. Click on it.

![](images/git_PR1.png)

## Creating a pull request

You will see that you are trying to merge `clo2_development` into `main` on the remote. It also requires you to write a description of what you did on your branch.

Add your partner's GitHub username as your reviewer, and talk about it!


## Guidelines on pull request discussions

For writers:

-   it provides context of the code changes you made.

-   it asks for explicit feedback of what kind of feedback is needed.

-   it is a a small and modular change that can be discussed.

For reviewers:

-   Do the proposed changes answer the solve the problem? Can you test it out in the working branch?

-   Is the code clear and readable?

-   Is the code efficient with computational resources?

-   Does the code stick to the style and conventions of this project?

. . .

Click *"Merge pull request"* to finish!

## GitHub issues

GitHub issues are a way for people to give feedback on your repository:

. . .

-   You publish a piece of software on GitHub, and other users try it out. 

. . .

-   They are confused about how to run your code,  so they return to the GitHub repository and post a GitHub issue documenting their error.

. . .

-   You can then create a branch from this issue, make changes to your code to resolve the error, then use the pull request model to merge it back to the main branch!
